# Counter game

Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game. 
They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of **2**. 
If it is, they divide it by **2**. If not, they reduce it by the next 
lower number which is a power of **2**. Whoever reduces the number 
to **1** wins the game. Louise always starts.

Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.

> **Example**

**n = 132**

It's Louise's turn first. She determines that **132** is not a power of **2**. 
The next lower power of**2** is **128**, so she subtracts that from **132** and 
passes **4** to Richard. **4** is a power of **2**, so Richard divides 
it by **2** and passes **2** to Louise. Likewise, **2** is a power 
so she divides it by **2** and reaches **1**. She wins the game.

**Update** If they initially set counter to **1**, Richard wins. Louise cannot make a move so she loses.

>**Function Description**

Complete the counterGame function in the editor below.

counterGame has the following parameter(s):

- int n: the initial game counter value

>**Returns**

- string: either Richard or Louise

>**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer **t**, the number of testcases.

Each of the next **t** lines contains an integer **n**, the initial value for each game.

> **Constraints**

- 1 &le; t &le; 10
- 1 &le; n &le; 2<sup>64 </sup> - 1


> **Sample Input 0**
```
1
6
```

> **Sample Output 0**
```
Richard
```

> **Explanation 0**

Here **n = 148** and **k = 3**, so **p = 148148148**.

```
 6 is not a power of 2 so Louise reduces it by the largest power of 2 less than 6: 6 - 4 = 2.
 2 is a power of 2 so Richard divides by 2 to get 1 and wins the game.
